## Description
**ChainRunners** is a groundbreaking decentralized application (dApp) that merges the drive of athletic competition with the immutability of blockchain technology. Our platform is built upon the core concept of commitment in competition, especially when that commitment is solidified in the blockchain. ChainRunners leverages the initial burst of enthusiasm athletes experience upon entering a contest, translating it into a binding, blockchain-based commitment through smart contracts.

Utilizing Ethereum for staking, ChainRunners offers a platform where physical effort is rewarded in the digital realm. By entering competitions with a stake in Ether, participants commit irrevocably, embedding their resolve in the blockchain. The integration with Strava's API through Chainlink allows real-time tracking of athletic performance, seamlessly connecting physical activities with digital incentives.

### What it Does
ChainRunners enables users to participate in blockchain-based athletic competitions. Athletes stake Ether to join, with each competition having a predefined buy-in amount. The dApp connects with Strava via Chainlink, tracking each participant's performance in real-time. Competitions are not just about participation; they reward real athletic achievements. The platform administers payouts at set intervals and ultimately rewards the top performers, fostering a community where fitness enthusiasts and technology aficionados come together.
